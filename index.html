      <p> In the United States there a many schools that are underfunded, which prevent kids from having a strong foundation for higher education. Public school funding in the United States comes from federal, state, and local sources, but because nearly half of those funds come from local property taxes, the system generates large funding differences between wealthy and impoverished communities.

       <h3>How will WE we put your money to use?</h3>
       <p>
          We will do our research on schools that are not being treated fairly because of where their location is, and send the money you donated to their school board so they can upgrade their programs.
